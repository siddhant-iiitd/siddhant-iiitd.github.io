Hi, I am Siddhant, a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Senior @ IIIT Delhi, India. I am interested in Natural Language Processing and actively researching in the field, having published at top conferences such AAAI. I am interested in applying NLP for Social Good as my vision in life is to leverage my knowledge of technology to a good cause. I am also interested in understanding how to relate textual and visual content to get a better understanding of social media data which is increasingly visual.

I am always up for collaborations, so if you have an idea in mind do not hesitate to hit me up!

*Currently Looking for PhD positions in NLP for Fall 2024!*
